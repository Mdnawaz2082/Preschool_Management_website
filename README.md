The MyPreschool website uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript for a responsive, animated UI. Flask handles the backend with Jinja2 for dynamic content and SQLite for data storage. Font Awesome icons, AOS animations, and email integration enhance user experience with a child-friendly, modern design.
